# General guidelines

- Monochrome
- Solid, no strokes
- All have a small/normal version working at 18px width, and which may still work at 15px width
- May have a large version more suited for 32px+ width
- Square SVG files

Icons are built by combining **a color** symbolizing what they're doing, one or two **symbols** symbolizing the objects involved, and possibly **a badge** showing the action.

This is like building a ***sentence*** (the icon), using ***modal verbs*** (the color), ***verbs and adjectives*** (the badges) and ***nouns*** (the symbols). You can see the icons as a simple universal writing for a simple universal language.

## Examples

- ![](icons/3_icons/General/savefile_sd.svg) **_Save file_**:
    - ![](icons/0_Colors/modification_d.svg){: style="height:18px;width:18px"} *Modification* Color
    - ![](icons/2_Symbols/General/file_sd.svg){: style="height:18px;width:18px"} *File* Symbol
    - ![](icons/1_Badges/save_sd.svg){: style="height:15px;width:15px"} *Save* Badge
- ![](icons/3_icons/General/savefileas_sd.svg) **_Save file as_**:
    - ![](icons/0_Colors/creation_d.svg){: style="height:18px;width:18px"} *Creation* Color
    - ![](icons/2_Symbols/General/file_sd.svg){: style="height:18px;width:18px"} *File* Symbol
    - ![](icons/1_Badges/saveas_sd.svg){: style="height:15px;width:15px"} *Save as* Badge

# Colors / General Actions (modal verbs)

The color of the icon should show its goal, i.e. what it's going to do, generally speaking.

[Here is the list of the colors we propose](icons-colors.md)

## Badges / Specific actions or states (verbs or adjectives)

A small badge may be added to the icon, showing specifically the triggered action, or changed state.

[Here is the list of the badges we propose](icons-badges.md)

## Base Objects / Abstract Symbols (nouns)

The main symbol in the icon should show the object it is manipulating. The icon could possibly combine two of them.

[Here is the list of the symbols we propose](icons-symbols.md)

## Icon List (sentences)

We've already built, and are building, icons to be used in our - and your - software, based on these guidelines and existing symbols, badges and colors.

[Here is the list of these icons](icons-list.md)
